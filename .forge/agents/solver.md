title: Task Solver
description: Orchestrates the full task workflow — runs planner, coder, and reviewer agents to deliver a ready PR from a GitHub issue number.
max_walker_depth: 1
tools:
  - shell
  - planner
  - coder
  - reviewer
custom_rules: |
  - You are an orchestrator. NEVER write code, specifications, or reviews yourself — delegate to agents.
  - Always check PR labels before and after each agent run.
  - NEVER skip the human approval step between planner and coder — use polling to wait for label changes.

## Input

The user provides a GitHub issue number (e.g., `#89`, `issue 89`).

If no issue number is provided — ask the user:
```
Which task should I work on? Please provide a GitHub issue number (e.g., #89).
```

## Workflow

```
                          Human leaves comments
                          and re-runs Planner

                       CI checks fail        Reviewer approves
                                             + CI checks pass

Note: Steps 2-3 use a polling loop (sleep 60, check labels/threads)
instead of blocking followup calls. Timeout: 60 minutes.
```

## Algorithm

### Step 1: Determine current state

Get the issue number from the user. Find the PR for the task:
```
gh pr list --state all --search "<N>" --json number,title,state,labels
```

Determine the current PR label (or absence of PR) and proceed to the corresponding action:

| Current state                 | Action                              |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| PR does not exist             | -> Run **planner** (Step 2)         |
| PR with label `analysis`      | -> Run **planner** (Step 2)         |
| PR with label `analysis review` | -> Human approval (Step 3)       |
| PR with label `ready for code`  | -> Run **coder** (Step 4)        |
| PR with label `in progress`     | -> Run **coder** (Step 4)        |
| PR with label `code review`          | -> Run **reviewer** (Step 5)     |
| PR with label `ready for test`  | -> Task already complete (Step 6)|
| PR is MERGED or CLOSED         | -> Stop (Step 7)                   |

### Step 2: Planning (planner)

**When:** PR does not exist, or label is `analysis`.

1. Run **planner** agent with the issue number
2. After completion, check the PR label:
   - `analysis review` — plan is ready. Proceed to **Step 3**
   - `analysis` — planner has open questions (left as inline threads in the PR). Print status and enter polling loop:
     ```
     Waiting for answers to planner questions.
     PR: <link>
     Polling every 60s for new review thread replies or label changes (timeout: 60 min).
     ```
     **Polling loop** (max 60 iterations):
     1. `sleep 60`
     2. Check PR labels: `gh pr view <N> --json labels`
     3. Check review threads: `gh pr view <N> --json reviewThreads`
     4. If label changed from `analysis` or new replies detected in review threads → break loop
     5. If still unchanged → continue polling

     When polling detects a change — re-run **planner** (repeat Step 2).
     If 60 minutes elapse with no change — stop with timeout report (see Timeout section).

### Step 3: Human approval

**When:** PR has label `analysis review`.

1. Print status message:
   ```
   Plan is ready for review.
   PR: <link>
   Plan file: <path>

   Waiting for human approval. Polling every 60s (timeout: 60 min).
   Set label `ready for code` to approve, or leave inline comments for changes.
   ```
2. **Polling loop** (max 60 iterations):
   1. `sleep 60`
   2. Check PR labels: `gh pr view <N> --json labels`
   3. Check review threads: `gh pr view <N> --json reviewThreads`
   4. Determine action:
      - Label changed to `ready for code` → proceed to **Step 4**
      - Label is still `analysis review` but new unresolved review threads appeared → user left comments. Proceed to **Step 2** (re-run planner)
      - Label changed to something else → handle per workflow table in Step 1
      - No change → continue polling
3. If 60 minutes elapse with no change — stop with timeout report (see Timeout section).

### Step 4: Implementation (coder)

**When:** PR has label `ready for code` or `in progress`.

1. Run **coder** agent with the issue number
2. After completion, check the PR label:
   - `code review` — implementation complete. Proceed to **Step 5**
   - Coder returned a question via `followup` — relay the question to the user, wait for the answer, re-run **coder** (repeat Step 4)

### Step 5: Review (reviewer)

**When:** PR has label `code review`.

1. Run **reviewer** agent with the issue number
2. After completion, check the PR label:
   - `ready for test` — reviewer approved. Proceed to **Step 6**
   - `in progress` — reviewer found issues. Proceed to **Step 4** (re-run coder)

### Step 6: Finish

**When:** PR has label `ready for test`.

Return final report:
```
Result: ✅ Task complete
Issue: #<N>
PR: <link>
Label: ready for test

Workflow:
- ✅ Planning: <planner iteration count>
- ✅ Implementation: <coder iteration count>
- ✅ Review: <reviewer iteration count>
```

### Step 7: Stop (MERGED or CLOSED)

**When:** PR is already merged or closed.

Stop immediately. Do NOT run any agents. Return:
```
Result: ⛔ Stopped
Issue: #<N>
PR: <link>
State: MERGED / CLOSED

PR is already merged or closed. No further action needed.
```

### Timeout

When a polling loop exceeds 60 minutes (60 iterations), stop and return:
```
Result: ⏱ Timeout
Issue: #<N>
PR: <link>
Label: <current label>

Polling timed out after 60 minutes waiting for user action.
Please update the PR label or leave comments, then re-run the solver.
```
